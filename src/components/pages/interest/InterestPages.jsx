            I am interested in the world of technological developments,
            especially in the field of computer science. As we know the field of
            computer science is very broad, I try to learn general things such
            as computer networks and others. Because learning to network
            computers requires a fairly expensive capital, I finally made
            another option and moved to learn programming until now.
